Large language models like GPT-2 have shown promising results on various NLP tasks, including question answering, thanks to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. \n\nHowever, out-of-the-box language models often struggle with QA tasks as they require specific skills such as reading comprehension, information extraction, and conditional text generation. Fine-tuning these models on QA datasets can significantly improve their performance and make them better suited for real-world applications.\n\nIn this project, we aim to fine-tune the GPT-2 model for improved question answering performance. We will use two popular QA datasets:\n\n1. **CNN/DailyMail**: This dataset contains articles from CNN and Daily Mail newspapers along with questions and answers generated from the article's summary points. It focuses on reading comprehension and summary-level QA.\n\n2. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: SQuAD is a large reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text from the corresponding article. \n\nBy fine-tuning GPT-2 on these datasets, we expect the model to learn to:\n- Better understand the context and extract relevant information\n- Focus on the key parts of the question to provide more accurate answers\n- Generate concise and coherent answers in natural language\n\nThe fine-tuned model will be evaluated using metrics such as perplexity and exact match/F1 scores commonly used for QA tasks. We aim to significantly improve upon the performance of the base GPT-2 model and develop a QA system that can be applied to real-world applications such as automated customer support, knowledge base querying, and more.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setup ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install wandb matplotlib torch datasets

We initialize a new wandb run with `wandb.init()`, specifying the project name as \"Ml project\" and the run name as \"gpt2-finetuning-improved\". \n\n2. We also define some configuration parameters in the `config` argument, such as the model name, architecture, dataset size, hyperparameters, etc. These configurations will be logged and can be used for comparison across different runs.\n\n3. We define a custom callback `ValidationCallback` that logs validation metrics (perplexity, loss, epoch) during the evaluation phase and training metrics (loss, epoch, learning rate, global step) during the logging phase. These callbacks allow us to track the model's performance over time.\n\n4. We load and prepare the datasets for training and evaluation using the `load_and_tokenize_datasets` function (defined earlier).\n\n5. We initialize the GPT-2 model and move it to the available device (GPU if available, else CPU).\n\n6. We define the training arguments with the `TrainingArguments` class, specifying parameters such as the output directory, number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, logging steps, etc. We also set up wandb for logging and define other training configurations.\n\n7. We initialize the `Trainer` with our model, training arguments, datasets, data collator, and our custom callback.\n\n8. We start the training process and measure the training time.\n\n9. If the training completes successfully, we log the final training metrics, save the trained model and tokenizer, and log the total training time to wandb. \n\n10. If an exception occurs during training, we log the error to wandb and raise the exception.\n\n11. Finally, we end the wandb run with `wandb.finish()` to ensure all logs are synced.\n\nThis cell sets up the training environment, initializes wandb for tracking the experiment, and kicks off the training process while logging relevant metrics.
